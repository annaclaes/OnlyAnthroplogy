# Hello World

Dear fellow humans

Welcome to OnlyAnthropology, a platform I created to share my experience about the mystery that is anthropological fielwork. On here, you will find information on all of my preparations and reflections from different stages of research, ranging from ethics, positionality, taking notes, interviewing, entering the field, shadowing, and more. I hope that this project will help make sense of the chaos that currently exists in my head. However, I am not doing this for myself only. I hope that sharing my progress will help you shed some light unto the "dark arts" (yes, by that I mean ethnographic fieldwork), and maybe encourage you to do the same.

Feel free to explore this page freely, and comment, edit, propose changes, critique, and more. My reflections are not ultimate truths, rather, they are invitations to further debate and means to open up the field of anthropology to all researchers who feel lost.

All the best

Anna
